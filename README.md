## Objectives  
- Analyze salaries by job title for data professionals.  
- Understand work-life balance and happiness with salary among respondents.  
- Study difficulty levels for breaking into the data field.  
- Compare preferences for programming languages across job roles.  
- Visualize the distribution of survey participants across countries.  

## Data Preparation  
Data Source: Survey dataset (Excel file) with 600+ rows.  

Cleaning & Transformation:  
- Removed missing or inconsistent data values.  
- Standardized job titles and country names.
